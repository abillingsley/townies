# Config

The config module stores any shared configuration files for the application.  Examples of things you find in this module are:

* secrets.ts, a file that reads or defines defaults for `process.env` variables
* database.ts, a file that uses secrets or defines defaults to configure a database connection
* app.ts, a file that defines application configuration settings
